This repository contains all the essential files for the Predictive Maintenance of Aircraft Engines project. It includes a Dockerfile for containerizing the application, a scaling1.pkl file containing the pre-trained machine learning model, and a Streamlit script (scaling1.pkl) to provide a user-friendly web interface for predictions. The repository is designed to simplify deployment and usage, enabling users to predict engine health and prevent potential failures efficiently.
